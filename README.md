# AWS Backup Setup for EC2 and RDS

This project demonstrates the deployment of a database-driven application on AWS and the implementation of a **reliable backup and recovery strategy** using **AWS Backup**. It ensures secure, automated, and scalable data protection for **EC2** and **RDS** resources.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Deploy a web server on an **EC2 instance**
- Launch and configure a **MySQL-compatible RDS instance**
- Automate backups for EC2 and RDS using **AWS Backup**
- Verify restore functionality and data availability
- Ensure **data integrity** and **disaster recovery readiness**

## ⚙️ Implementation Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Launch EC2 Instance
- Created a `t2.micro` instance in **us-east-2a**
- Configured security group to allow:
  - SSH (port 22)
  - HTTP (port 80)

### ✅ Step 2: Install Apache on EC2

sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 -y
✅ Step 3: Launch Amazon RDS
Instance type: db.t4g.micro

DB name: backup-project-db

MySQL version: 8.0

Connected via MySQL client from EC2

✅ Step 4: Create and Populate Database

CREATE DATABASE testdb;
USE testdb;

CREATE TABLE sample_table (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO sample_table (name) VALUES ('Backup Test 1'), ('Backup Test 2');
SELECT * FROM sample_table;
✅ Step 5: Configure AWS Backup
Created backup vaults

Defined backup plans for EC2 and RDS

Ran backup jobs successfully

✅ Step 6: Verify Backups
Confirmed recovery points in AWS Backup vaults

Performed and validated restore functionality

📊 Results
✅ EC2 Instance running (ID: i-052b662c771a8382d) — IP: 3.148.208.56

✅ RDS Instance backup-project-db live with sample data

✅ AWS Backup Vaults contain recovery points for EC2 & RDS

✅ Backup Jobs completed successfully with Success status

📝 Conclusion
This project successfully showcases how to:

Deploy an application on AWS using EC2 and RDS

Implement and test automated backup strategies with AWS Backup

Ensure data availability, resilience, and disaster recovery readiness

It provides a real-world demonstration of cloud infrastructure management and emphasizes the importance of automated data protection in production environments.
